# image-embedding-categories

This repository contains code and experiments for image embedding and clustering.

The main objective is to explore methods for grouping images without predefined categories — by analyzing their semantic embeddings.

We’re currently focusing on social media images to see if we can discover clusters and patterns in their content, and whether these clusters correlate with engagement or other factors.

## Tech Stack

1. Python

2. Transformers (ViT base model)

3. Clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means, DBSCAN)

## Status

This is a work in progress — a personal project to learn and experiment with unsupervised image clustering.
